Optimized Phase Change Memory (PCM) hardware using machine learning as part of a collaborative research team from CSUN and partner universities. 

Developed predictive models (XGBoost and MLP neural network) to estimate write costs, achieving RMSE of 0.01 (XGBoost) and 0.1 (MLP NN), RÂ² of 0.999, and 99% accuracy. 

Integrated predictions into an optimization framework that redistributed workloads to reduce energy consumption and enhance memory durability.

Presented findings via research report, poster, and presentation to faculty, students, and industry professionals.
